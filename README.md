[How to set up?]
1. Copy the file from the "server pack" folder and paste it into your Minecraft server folder.
2. Change the variable values in the '.properties' file located in your Minecraft server folder to match your Discord server.
3. If you want to start your Minecraft server, run 'chatting interlocker.exe' instead of the server launcher.

[warning]
this program tested just basic Minecraft server. If you using mod server, you should change 'launcher' variable value in 'properties'. If it doesn't work, please enter the command to run your modded Minecraft server launcher in the 'launcher' variable value within the '.properties' file.
